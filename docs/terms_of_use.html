      <p>We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with our Apps, to protect yourself in case of problems with our Apps.</p>
      <p>Our Apps have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of our Apps (as described on the app stores where ours Apps are available and in the related documentation) meet your requirements.</p>
      <p>If our provision of support for our Apps is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay.

      <p>We may terminate these Terms and your use of our Apps, or suspend your use of our Apps, immediately by written notice to you if:</p>

        <li>we consider that you have used our Apps in violation of these Terms;</li>
        <li>we believe there has been unauthorised access to our Apps;</li>
        <li>we, at our sole discretion, decide to withdraw our Apps (whether in whole or in part);</li>

      </ol>
      <p>We may discontinue licensing any of the App Content at any time at our sole discretion. In this instance you will be able to continue to use our Apps with the App Content, but it will no longer be available on app stores and will no longer be supported by us.</p>
      <p>You can terminate these Terms by ceasing to use our Apps and deleting or uninstalling it from your device.</p>
      <p>Upon termination for any reason:</p>

        <li>you must delete or remove our Apps from your device.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>GENERAL</h3>
      <p>This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to allow anyone other than you or us to enforce any term of these Terms or of the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
      <p>These Terms are governed by English law (including non-contractual disputes or claims) and legal proceedings in respect of these Terms and our Apps shall be dealt with exclusively by the English courts.</p>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the relevant provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, and the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <p>Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of these Terms by you. Accordingly, we shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of these Terms.</p>
